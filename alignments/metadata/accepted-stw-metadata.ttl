He employs the municipality's personnel and has local competence (schools, town planning, social action, streets, school transport, collection of household waste, sewerage, etc.).He is also an agent of the State for the functions of civil status, public order, the organisation of elections and the issuance of regulatory titles.At 1 January 2010, there were 36,682 municipalities, including 36,570 in Metropolitan France."@en ;
